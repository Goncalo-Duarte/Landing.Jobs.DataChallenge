# Landing.Jobs Data Challenge

## "Just a data science enthusiast" - Gon√ßalo Duarte

### My main goal:

   *To show anyone who reads this, that if you were born a woman or identify as a woman, you are in disadvantage!*


### Description:

"Every year Landing.jobs launches the Tech Careers Report, an immersive report  on the portuguese community of tech professionals that analyses salaries, motivations and other dimensions in the tech market in Portugal."

The following report is divided in four stages:

   - <b>1st: Who answered the survey? </b>
       
       As in any analysis, it is important that we know the characteristic of our sample. People are more that just numbers, it goes beyond data. So first, we will study some features of the people who entered the survey as:
           - Age
           - Gender
           - Residence
           - Education Level
           - Working Experience
           - Job Roles

   - <b>2nd: What does impact the salary?<b>

                   
    
         2.1 - Proving that being a woman does make you make LESS money! Why do we need a change?
         2.2 - Which programming languages will make your salary increase?
     

   - <b>3rd: The COVID impact </b>
   
   
   
          - The impact on salaries and how older people adjusted to remote work!
   


   - <b>5th: The power of data: Predicting Salaries </b>
   
            
          - Once again, how being a woman has a negative coefficient when predicting a salary!
(*Using linear regression to prove that your gender is a significant feature and how women are in disadvantage*)


### Disclaimer:
On the majority of work developed on this report, only Males and Females were considered. This was only done to simplify the analysis, not to take any importance from those who don't identifiy as men or women, or simply were not comfortable disclosing that information!
